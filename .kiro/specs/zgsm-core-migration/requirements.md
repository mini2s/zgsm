# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the ZGSM extension functionality from `/home/mini/workspace/zgsm/zgsm` to `/home/mini/workspace/zgsm/src/core` and reorganizing the codebase by functional modules. The migration aims to consolidate the codebase structure, improve maintainability, and create a more organized modular architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ZGSM extension functionality to be migrated to the main src/core directory, so that the codebase has a unified structure and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all functionality from `/zgsm/src/` SHALL be moved to `/src/core/zgsm/`
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the original `/zgsm/` directory SHALL be removed or deprecated
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all import paths SHALL be updated to reflect the new structure
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the extension SHALL continue to function exactly as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ZGSM functionality to be organized by functional modules, so that related code is grouped together and the architecture is more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN code completion functionality SHALL be organized in a dedicated module
2. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN code lens functionality SHALL be organized in a dedicated module
3. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN common utilities SHALL be organized in a shared module
4. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN internationalization SHALL be organized in a dedicated module
5. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN each module SHALL have clear boundaries and responsibilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension entry point to be updated, so that it properly initializes the migrated modules from their new locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the entry point is updated THEN the main extension.ts SHALL import from the new module locations
2. WHEN the entry point is updated THEN all command registrations SHALL work with the new module structure
3. WHEN the entry point is updated THEN the activation process SHALL remain unchanged from a user perspective
4. WHEN the entry point is updated THEN error handling SHALL be preserved during the migration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and configuration files to be updated, so that they work with the new directory structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is updated THEN TypeScript configuration SHALL include the new paths
2. WHEN configuration is updated THEN build scripts SHALL compile from the new locations
3. WHEN configuration is updated THEN package.json SHALL reference the correct entry points
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN VS Code extension manifest SHALL point to the correct files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the migration doesn't break existing functionality, so that users experience no disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is complete THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass with the new structure
2. WHEN testing is complete THEN integration tests SHALL verify the extension loads correctly
3. WHEN testing is complete THEN manual testing SHALL confirm all features work as expected
4. WHEN testing is complete THEN performance SHALL be equivalent to the pre-migration state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the new module structure, so that future development follows the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is complete THEN module responsibilities SHALL be clearly defined
2. WHEN documentation is complete THEN import/export patterns SHALL be documented
3. WHEN documentation is complete THEN migration steps SHALL be recorded for future reference
4. WHEN documentation is complete THEN architectural decisions SHALL be explained
